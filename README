== NavUtil - An example program ==

This program documents one of the difficulties I currently face. It's pretty simple, really.

I want to write an app that, when I press the "Info" button, flips over to a Settings page.

This settings page should be a NavigationController at the top, and allow me to push and pop
UIViewControllers easily, so I can set the different properties in my settings view easily.

I can do almost all of this, but I'm stuck on the part where I insert the UINavigationController.

It's got to be something extremely simple that I am missing; if you know and can point it out, that
would be fantastic!
