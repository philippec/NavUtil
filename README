# NavUtil - An example program #

This program documents one of the difficulties I had. It's pretty simple, really.

I want to write an app that, when I press the "Info" button, flips over to a Settings page.

This settings page should be a NavigationController at the top, and allow me to push and pop
UIViewControllers easily, so I can set the different properties in my settings view easily.

Thanks to shawnhyam for pointing out the way to do this.

I have complemented the app with a detail view controller so you can see it in action.

I have also added a second section in the UITableView showing some embedded switches, for your entertainement.
