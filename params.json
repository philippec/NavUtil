{"name":"Navutil","body":"# NavUtil - An example program\r\n\r\nThis program documents one of the difficulties I had. It's pretty simple, really.\r\n\r\nI want to write an app that, when I press the \"Info\" button, flips over to a Settings page.\r\n\r\nThis settings page should be a NavigationController at the top, and allow me to push and pop\r\nUIViewControllers easily, so I can set the different properties in my settings view easily.\r\n\r\nThanks to shawnhyam for pointing out the way to do this.\r\n\r\nI have complemented the app with a detail view controller so you can see it in action.\r\n\r\nI have also added a second section in the UITableView showing some embedded switches, for your entertainement.\r\n\r\nPhilippe Casgrain","tagline":"Shows how to do a NavigationController interface in a Utility window","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
